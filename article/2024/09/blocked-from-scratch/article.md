Subject: Request for Account Unblock and Pledge to Contribute to the Scratch Community

Dear Scratch Team,

I am writing to express my sincere apologies for the recent blocking of my Scratch account.

I received a notification stating, "Your Scratch account has been blocked for abusing the platform by making/using extensions to create fake comments and comment on closed comment sections."

I have been learning programming primarily using JavaScript/TypeScript and also Python. I created a Scratch extension called "Scratch Comment Emulator" with the intention of deepening my understanding of programming by expanding Scratch's functionality. However, during the testing phase for this extension, I engaged in actions that violated the platform's terms of service by emulating comments, which I deeply regret.

I want to assure you that my actions were solely motivated by a desire to learn programming and were not intended to harm or disrupt the community in any way.

I understand that my actions violated Scratch's terms of service and caused inconvenience to other users and the community as a whole. I am truly sorry for this. Going forward, I will strictly adhere to Scratch's terms of service and community guidelines. As soon as my account is restored, I will promptly remove the "Scratch Comment Emulator" extension from Scratch and continue my programming studies with greater care for the community.

Scratch has been a valuable platform for me to learn and enjoy programming. I am eager to continue expanding my programming knowledge and creating more innovative projects. In the future, I hope to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to the Scratch community by developing extensions or projects that benefit other users.

I kindly request that you reconsider my account blocking.

Sincerely,
The Infinitys
